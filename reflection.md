### 01-HTML
I needed to use the notes in order to do these exercises. I am trying to learn the rules and syntax - so hopefully this gets better with time.

These exercises were a good introduction to interacting with html. Had enough instructions / guidelines to know what to do.


### 02-a11y
I was able to complete the exercises with help from the slides / online resources. I think I need more time before I can know the syntax without looking at a reference.

This exercise was helpful as forms are everywhere online, so I can see the use of this.

I don't think anything else would be better to learn form, as this was a good simple for to get started.

### 03-css
I also needed help for these lab assignments by looking at the material, however as I was doing some of the CSS, I got a hang of it more.

This lab helped me understand how the CSS file actually interacts with the html script, modifying the page visually. I don't know much about other frameworks, but I can already extrapolate how using raw CSS in a software engineering context might become messy, or I could just be bad right now. 

I am just thinking of the case where I keep making high specificity additions, and my file can get bloated.

### 04-flex box
These lab exercises were the most difficult yet, and I remmeber for some of them I had to reset and try again. I needed to refer back to the notes as well. I think when I initially tried to brute force some of the layouts, and it wasn't the right way to do - especially if the design needed to be more dynamic (like another box being added). 

I found that the best solution that I personally found ended up being a lot more simpler that what I had originally.

These exercises were helpful but I 100% need more practice with flexbox.

### 05-cssgrid
Going into this lab, I expected it to be more difficult. Especially since I had some troubles doing some of the flex box in the 4th lab. But I found it to be straightforward, the designs in the images weren't crazy. 

Using the media query was really cool. I found it to be simple to use and gave me insight on how to create responsive designs. I also thought how it is interesting that the mobile version is the "default".

 One thing that messed me up though was  the article and aside section switching.

But I thought this lab was the most helpful out of all of them, or at least my favorite.

### 06-bootstrap
Bootstrap is one of those words I've heard being thrown around on the internet, so I was excited to get some experience with it. I needed to use the notes / online resources for this as well. But I found it helpful that what we implemented is the same / similar to what we did prior but instead using raw css.

I think that helped highlight the differences while not making me too confused.

### 07-javascript
This lab was really cool as I got to manipulate data, similar to what we are used to in the lower division classes. I needed help with some of the syntax, but the resource that you linked was helpful for that.

I also found a lot of ways to do the same thing (using loop or function etc), so I would want to dig deeper with javascript. I thought these exercises were helpful as each part of the assignment was sectioned off nicely and showcased a different method(? don't know if that is the correct term) of javascript.

### 08-jquery
I needed to use documentation and the notes for this lab, and what I noticed about jquery is that the syntax makes it very short - which is nice. Truthfully though this is probablly the thing I would need to review most in this class, I don't think I have been exposed enough - even considering the last day of class. But we didn't have more days so I understand, I will look into it in my own time.

So I have nothing that can be explained better - I think I just need more time with this one.
